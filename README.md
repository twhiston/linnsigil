# LinnSigil

Magic Squares on the Linnstrument via max/msp.

Map any pattern onto the linnstrument across octaves, optionally collapse patterns to single octaves.

Inspired by (and reusing some patching from) the [Linnstrument LED controls](http://benfuhrman.com/linnstrument-led-controls/), and magic squares generated by [sigil pen](https://technomancy101.com/sigilpen/)
